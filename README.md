This is a repository for a programming exercise in Go.


**Instructions for running**

In these steps, the '$' is not meant to be typed, it indicates what to type at
your terminal prompt.

2. From inside the repository directory, build and install via $go install
3. Run the program as a standalone command: $jc-assignment
4. The program listens on localhost:8080 by default. The port can be changed
